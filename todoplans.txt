0)  BUG: Monsters are inconsistent about attacking player.  Monsters need to be re-entered into creatures.txt.
0)  BUG: Save / restore not working properly.  Darkvision is not kept over save and restore.
0)  BUG: Sometimes the minimap does not get drawn properly.  Consider divorcing minimap from Display method.
0)  BUG: Sometimes doors do not get drawn.  None of them, on the entire map.
1)  Implement condition poisoned.
2)  Consider the possibility of traps, perhaps limited to room interiors.  Perhaps a Trap class.
2)  Consider the possibility of hidden doors and hidden passageways.  (Part 1: implementing Hidden seen type, done.)
2)  Implement more spell effects and damages.  Consider opening Spell class to not bother with enum.
2)  Consider a simplified (guided) player initialization.
2)  Implement cones, lines, etc for AoE spell areas.
3)  Temporary paths or doors could make things like passwall spells make sense.
3)  Allow for digging, either with pick or perhaps a wand of digging, etc.
3)  Consider a teleport spell (scroll, spell book, wand, etc) both random and guided.  Different types of teleport.
3)  Adjust Attack class to allow for save DCs instead of tohit bonus or in addition to handle special effects.  Consider changing Effect Effect to SpellEffect Effect.
3)  Allow for different types of doors.  Closed, locked, etc.  Consider ramifications for display as currently doors are treated as doorways.
4)  Consider a tutorial.  And/or suggesting Explorer class.
4)  Keep in mind the idea of the NetHack kitchen sink, constrained by 5e rules.
